# react-native-image-uploader

This is an example React Native app I created. It is paired with this [nestjs-boilerplate](https://github.com/christroutner/nestjs-boilerplate) back end.

A user login screen is presented at first. Once the user logs in, the app gets permissions to access the camera and media library. A picture can be taken with the camera, which is then uploaded to the back end server.
